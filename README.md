# Character manager with CRUD
THE PAGE IS NOW ONLINE [HERE](https://biomath-421.github.io/character-manager/index.html)

This was an exercice for BeCode, the goal was to use what we learned about Javascript/Async&Await&Fetch Requests/API's to make a webpage and be capable of making a CRUD from an existing API.
We were encouraged to use Postman, Axios and Parcel to practise
This was made during our second month at BeCode, from late June to early July
